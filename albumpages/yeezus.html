					Yeezus is the sixth studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released on June 18, 2013, by Def Jam Recordings. West gathered a number of artists and close collaborators for production on the album, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, Noah Goldstein, Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Travis Scott. Yeezus also features guest vocals from Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson and Frank Ocean. Fifteen days before its release date, West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.

					Yeezus has been characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, dancehall, punk, and Chicago drill. It also continues West's unconventional use of samples, as on "Blood on the Leaves," which prominently interpolates Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of "Strange Fruit". The release features no album artwork, and the physical CD edition of the album was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits. Initial promotion of Yeezus included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances. West released two singles from the album, the song "Black Skinhead" in July 2013 and "Bound 2" the following month.

					Yeezus received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it among West's best work and commended its brash direction, though public response proved considerably more divided. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 327,000 copies in its first week of release. It topped the charts of 30 other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. Yeezus was nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album. As of 2016, the album has sold 750,000 copies in the United States.
