					The Life of Pablo is the seventh studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released on February 14, 2016, by GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings. Recording sessions took place from 2013 to 2016, in Italy, Mexico, Canada and the United States. Record production on the album was handled by West and a variety of producers, including Mike Dean, Noah Goldstein, Metro Boomin, Rick Rubin, Hudson Mohawke. He also enlisted a wide array of guest vocalists, including The Weeknd, Ty Dolla Sign, Desiigner, Kid Cudi, The-Dream, Chance the Rapper, Rihanna, Sampha, Post Malone, Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean.

					The Life of Pablo was preceded by several promotional singles as part of West's GOOD Fridays giveaways, including the tracks "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in LA". In the months before its release, the album's title and track list went through several publicized changes, and West's erratic activity on social media became the source of several controversies. An early version of the album was premiered by West on February 11, 2016, at Madison Square Garden as part of his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show in collaboration with Adidas. After several additional recording sessions and alterations, the album was launched exclusively through the streaming service Tidal three days later.

					Following the official streaming debut of The Life of Pablo, West continued to make changes to the music, describing it as "a living, breathing, changing, creative expression" and declaring the end of the album as a dominant release form. Def Jam confirmed his intention to continue working on the album over the subsequent months. A largely updated version of the album, which included alternate mixes and other changes, was made available on other streaming services and for digital purchase on his website on April 1, 2016; no official physical CD release is planned. The album was supported by the singles "Famous", "Father Stretch My Hands", and "Fade".

					The Life of Pablo received positive reviews from critics, with particular attention drawn to the fragmented, unfinished nature of its composition and release. Following Tidal's disclosure of its streaming data and the album's release to competing streaming services, The Life of Pablo debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming West's seventh consecutive number one album on the chart and the first album to reach the summit primarily through streaming. In April 2017, The Life of Pablo became the first streaming only album to go platinum, becoming West's eighth platinum album. It was named among the best albums of 2016 by multiple publications, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, while both "Ultralight Beam" and "Famous" were nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song.
